## Alphonse

Nuclear physicist with limited programming knowledges, he has been using Fortran for thirty years to implement mathematical and physical models.

He wants to use Kokkos for his three-dimensional code that has to run on GPU.

## Béatrice

CFD programmer in the industry, she has been using Kokkos for one year on two different projects that run on CPU and GPU.

She wants to code with Kokkos efficiently without getting lost in the documentation.

## Christophe

Former CUDA developper for six years, he is specialized in GPU code tuning.

He wants to transition to Kokkos to target other GPUs without having to learn their specific language.

## Dolorès

Undergraduate student in computer sciences, she knows GPU programming, machine learning, and various modern stacks.

She wants to learn Kokkos for her six-month long internship on GPU computing.
